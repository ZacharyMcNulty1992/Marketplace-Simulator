# Marketplace-Simulator

This project is to learn about golang goroutines.

This is just a simple market place simulator.

Currently this project is just for fun, and using nothing outside of the standard golang libs.

## Building
Use `make` to build the initial executable
run via `./bin/app -config .`

config is a json file located in /config
Values in here will modify large chunks of the emulation.
